# UploadIt: File sharing, confined to your network

This is a simple side project of mine. It began with my [serv](https://github.com/s4Dt0y/serv) project
implemented in rust (Btw, do not use that, use updog, serv is unstable and feature-lacking).
However, I decided to use python instead of rust, because, let's be real, python is so much easier.
Forgive me, all rustaceans. So, yeah. UploadIt is an implementation of the python http server with a gui.
Of course, this repo is still private because I just started building it. Be patient.
